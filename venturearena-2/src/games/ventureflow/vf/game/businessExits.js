// ============================================================================
// Business exit events — rare "sell for a multiple of annual revenue" offers
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Roughly once every ~6 months (BUSINESS_EXIT_CHANCE_PER_MONTH, a per-month
// coin flip rather than a fixed schedule, so it stays a surprise rather than
// clockwork) the table gets a shot at an acquisition offer: someone wants to
// buy ONE business, for a random multiple of its current ANNUAL revenue —
// monthly income × 12, the standard way a real business valuation is framed
// (1x/2x/4x/8x/15x — see BUSINESS_EXIT_MULTIPLIER_WEIGHTS in gameConfig.js,
// weighted so 2x/4x are common and 15x is a true jackpot). This directly
// rewards every dollar put into Marketing/Sales/Ops/R&D upgrades (see
// businessUpgrades.js) — a business earning more per month is worth more
// the instant an offer shows up, turning "should I upgrade this business"
// into a bet with a real, occasional jackpot payoff, not just a slow
// monthly trickle.
//
// RNG: every draw here is on the ENVIRONMENT stream (envChance/
// envWeightedPick/envRandomInt — see game/rng.js's module comment), same as
// weather/price/fortune cards — and, critically, drawn in a FIXED order
// every single month (chance first, then — only if it fires — multiplier
// and target-index) regardless of which players actually own a business.
// Skipping the multiplier/target draws on a month where nobody happens to
// own a business would make the environment stream's draw COUNT depend on
// player choices (who built a business, and when), which is exactly the
// class of Daily-Challenge-desync bug fixed earlier for Tree House rent —
// see rng.js's module comment. So the target index is always drawn against
// the FULL, fixed-size player roster; if that player turns out to own
// nothing, the offer is simply a no one-was-there no-op — same spirit as
// decks.js's perUnitCash effect quietly no-op'ing for a non-owner.
