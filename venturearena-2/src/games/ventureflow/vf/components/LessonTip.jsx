/**
 * A small "❓" affordance that expands into the matching FINANCIAL_LESSONS
 * blurb (gameConfig.js) — the on-demand counterpart to game/lessons.js's
 * one-time "first time this happens" callout in the event log. Tap it any
 * time "Teach Me" mode is on, as many times as you like, on whichever
 * significant game element it's attached to (see hooks/useTeachMode.js).
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when Teach Me mode is off, so a player who hasn't
 * turned it on sees the board exactly as it's always looked — this is
 * purely additive UI, never a layout change for anyone who doesn't want it.
 *
 * Expands in normal document flow (not an absolutely-positioned popover) —
 * simpler, and avoids clipping inside any of the scrollable/rounded cards
 * it lives in.
