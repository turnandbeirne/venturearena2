// ============================================================================
// Turn / month-cycle engine
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Orchestrates what happens when a player ends their turn: advance to the
// next player, or — once everyone has gone — resolve the whole month
// (income, price drift, weather tick, fortune cards, business exit offers,
// badges) and either start the next month or end the game.
//
// Month-end resolution is a TWO-PHASE process when a business-exit buyout
// offer (see game/businessExits.js) lands on a HUMAN player: phase one
// (beginMonthEnd, below) resolves R&D/business-decline/the exit ROLL, then
// PAUSES — status becomes 'exitOffer' and nothing past that point (payday,
// fortune cards, badges, ...) has happened yet — so the player can actually
// decide whether to accept the buyout instead of it just auto-resolving.
// resolveExitOfferDecision() (called once the player picks) applies their
// choice and then runs the rest of the month (finishMonthEnd) to completion.
// An offer landing on an AI player never pauses — aiDecideExitOffer() below
// decides instantly and month-end resolution proceeds in one call, exactly
// like every other month-end step always has.
