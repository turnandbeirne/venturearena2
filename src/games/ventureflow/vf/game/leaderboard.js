// ============================================================================
// Leaderboard — persistent high-score list (separate from game save/resume)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Stored in its own localStorage key so it survives "New Game" / "Play
// Again" and isn't tied to any single in-progress game. Entries are opt-in:
// nothing is saved here automatically when a game ends — a player chooses
// to add their result (see GameOverScreen).
//
// `email` is stored on the entry (so it's there if VentureMaker ever wants
// to follow up about a milestone, a future VentureScouts tie-in, etc.) but
// is NEVER read by any rendering code — see LeaderboardModal.jsx, which
// only ever reads name/avatar/netWorth/mode/difficultyId/playedAt/portfolio
// off an entry.
//
// `portfolio` is an optional frozen "hard copy" snapshot of the winner's
// assets/businesses/avg-purchase-prices at the moment they saved their
// score (see GameOverScreen's buildPortfolioSnapshot) — it never changes
// again even if they go play another game, so the leaderboard remembers
// exactly how that win was built.
