// ============================================================================
// Shared ("Global") leaderboard — scores that outlive one browser
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// game/leaderboard.js keeps a leaderboard in localStorage. That's per
// browser AND per origin, which is why a friend who played the game saw
// nobody but themselves on it, and why moving the game to a new domain
// looks like the board was wiped. This module is the shared version: one
// table in Supabase that every copy of the game reads from and writes to.
//
// Deliberately talks to PostgREST over plain `fetch` rather than pulling in
// @supabase/supabase-js. The whole interaction is two HTTP calls, and the
// game's promise is that it works offline once loaded — adding a ~40kB
// client and its dependencies to do a GET and a POST isn't a trade worth
// making.
//
// EVERY call fails soft. The global board is a bonus on top of the local
// one, so no network error, blocked request, or missing configuration is
// ever allowed to break a game that just ended: callers get `null`/`false`
// and the UI shows the local board plus an honest "couldn't reach it" note.
//
// The publishable (anon) key below is meant to be public — it's the same key
// shipped in the JS of any Supabase-backed site. What actually guards the
// table is its row-level security policy: read allowed, insert allowed,
// update and delete allowed to nobody. See the
// `ventureflow_global_scores` migration.
// ============================================================================

// VentureArena v2: both blank ON PURPOSE. Inside the arena the game must not
// call a third-party service, and standings are recorded by the arena itself
// when a table finishes. Blanking these is the switch this file was built
// with (see isGlobalLeaderboardEnabled below): the "Global" tabs and the
// publish-on-save step disappear and nothing here ever calls fetch().
// The standalone VentureFlow site keeps its own copy with the real values.
