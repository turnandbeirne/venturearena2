// ============================================================================
// Shareable recap link — no server, no account, no expiry
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Builds a small JSON summary of a finished game (standings, concepts
// touched, per-player insights) and packs it straight into a URL, base64
// in the fragment (`#...`) rather than a server-side id. A parent or
// teacher who opens the link sees a read-only recap page
// (components/RecapViewer.jsx, mounted at the static `/recap` route in
// main.jsx) with NO round trip to any backend — the link IS the data. That
// also means it never expires and never 404s because a database got reset,
// at the cost of not being editable/revocable after the fact, which is the
// right trade for a one-time "here's how it went" note.
//
// Deliberately NOT the same payload as game/gameRecord.js's downloads: the
// play-by-play log and full cash ledger are left OUT here on purpose,
// because a fragment carrying an entire game's log would make for an
// unreasonably long link to text or email. Someone who wants the full
// detail still has the Download row (GameOverScreen.jsx) for that; this is
// the "quick, shareable overview" version of the same story.
//
// The fragment (everything after '#') is never sent to any server on a
// normal link click/load — only the JS on the page itself reads it — so
// this is exactly as private as the link itself: whoever the sender shares
// it with, and no one else, the same as any other secret-link scheme.
