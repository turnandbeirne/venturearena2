// Wealth pile — a visual "stack" of icons next to a player's name that
// grows as their net worth grows: coins first, then cash bundles, jewels,
// and finally big-ticket toys (a car, a house, a yacht). Purely cosmetic —
// derived entirely from net worth, nothing here is read by any other game
// system — but kept in game/ rather than components/ to match this
// project's convention of pure, presentation-agnostic logic living
// separately from the React that renders it (see businessHealthStatus in
// businessUpgrades.js for the same pattern).

/** Each tier's `threshold` is the net worth (inclusive) at which its icon

 * threshold shows every icon at once, reading as a genuine "pile" that
 * keeps growing rather than one icon that just gets swapped out. Ordered
 * roughly the way a growing fortune would actually look: loose change,
 * then folding cash, then jewelry, then the big lifestyle purchases. */
