// ============================================================================
// The in-game rulebook
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One place a player can look up how ANY part of VentureFlow works, without
// leaving the game — opened from the 📖 button next to the leaderboard on
// the board (components/RulebookModal.jsx) and from the setup screen.
//
// Every number in here is READ FROM gameConfig.js rather than typed out, so
// the rulebook can't drift out of sync with the rules it's describing: retune
// a constant and the rulebook re-renders with the new value on the next
// build. That's the whole reason this is a builder function over live config
// instead of a static markdown file.
//
// buildRulebook() takes the CURRENT game's difficulty/scenario (or nothing,
// on the setup screen) so the money figures shown are the ones actually in
// play, not the defaults.
