// grow a business so far. Marketing used to have NO cap at all — the
// reasoning being that each campaign costs real cash and fades after a few
// months, so it would price itself out. It didn't: because a campaign's
// boost is a % of current income and buyout offers are a multiple of ANNUAL
// revenue (see BUSINESS_EXIT_MULTIPLIER_WEIGHTS above), a player sitting on
// a big cash pile could stack campaign after campaign on one business,
// spike its revenue far past anything the other tracks allow, and then cash
// out a buyout offer priced off that inflated number. That's a genuine
// exploit — unbounded, and the single biggest source of runaway wealth in
// the game.
//
// The fix keeps Marketing uncapped in ABSOLUTE terms while tying it to real
// business-building: every non-Marketing upgrade bought for a business
// (each Sales level, each Ops level, each R&D project) earns that business
// MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_PER_UPGRADE campaigns, and every business starts with
// MARKETING_FREE_CAMPAIGNS so a brand-new one can still advertise at all.
// So a business with 2 R&D + 3 Ops + 1 Sales = 6 upgrades can run up to 12
// campaigns; one with nothing else bought can run 2. Counted PER BUSINESS
// (not across the portfolio), since that's the level every other cap works
// at, and enforced in game/businessUpgrades.js's canUpgradeTrack — which
// game/aiEngine.js already routes through, so robots are bound by the exact
// same rule as human players.
//
// Note the cap counts campaigns LAUNCHED, not campaigns currently active —
// letting expired ones free up room would just restore the exploit on a
// slower clock.
export const MARKETING_CAMPAIGNS_PER_UPGRADE = 2;
export const MARKETING_FREE_CAMPAIGNS = 2;

// The one deliberate hole in that cap, and it exists to stop the cap from
// creating a worse problem than the exploit it closed.
//
// Buying ANY upgrade resets a business's decline clock (see
// BUSINESS_DECLINE_* below). But Sales, Operations and R&D all cap out
// permanently — a fully-built business is 3/3 Sales, 3/3 Ops, 2/2 R&D — so
// once its 16 campaigns were also gone, there would be literally no purchase
// left that counts as tending it. The player's best-built business would
// then decline forever with no legal remedy. That's a strictly worse outcome
// than the buyout exploit.
//
// So: regardless of the allowance, a business can always run
// MARKETING_UPKEEP_CAMPAIGNS_PER_MONTH campaign(s) per month at full price.
// Crucially this is per MONTH, not per purchase — the exploit was stacking
// an unbounded number of campaigns inside a single turn to spike revenue
// right before a buyout, and one-per-month can't do that: since a campaign
// lasts MARKETING_BOOST_MONTHS, upkeep alone can never have more than
// MARKETING_BOOST_MONTHS boosts live at once, no matter how much cash is on
// the table. An upkeep campaign does NOT count against the earned allowance

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Fortune card decks
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every card carries a kid-friendly "why" — the money lesson behind what
// just happened. A card carries either a single `effect` object OR an
// `effects` array, both read by src/game/decks.js's applyCardEffect.
//
// TWO RULES THESE CARDS FOLLOW, both learned the hard way:
//
// 1. AN ASSET CARD ONLY AFFECTS SOMEONE WHO OWNS THAT ASSET. Cards used to
//    hand out flat cash with asset flavour attached — "Tree House Tourists,
//    +$50" paid a player who had never bought a Tree House, and "Piggy Bank
//    Interest, +$25" paid someone with no savings. That taught exactly the
//    wrong lesson: in this game money is supposed to come from what you
//    own. Anything themed around an asset now uses `perUnitCash` or
//    `assetUnits`, which scale with holdings and cleanly no-op (with an
//    honest "no Tree Houses owned — no effect" log line) for everyone else.
//    `assetPrice` is the one exception and is used deliberately: it's
//    market news, it moves the shared price table, and it therefore only
//    ever matters to holders anyway.
//
// 2. A SETBACK SHOULD COST SOMETHING THAT MATTERS. "You lost a library book,
//    -$15" is not a financial lesson, it's a rounding error. The setbacks
//    below are the kinds of thing that actually derail a small operation: a
//    partner walking away, equipment failing, a bank going under, a
//    supplier raising prices. They're bigger, they're recoverable, and each
//    one has a real-world concept attached.
//
// Effect kinds understood by the engine:
//   cash                 { amount }                     flat dollars, + or -
//   cashPercent          { percent }                    % of current cash, + or -
//   assetPrice           { assetId | 'all', percent }   bumps a price (market news)
//   skillToken           { amount }                     + or - skill tokens (floors at 0)
//   passiveBonus         { amount }                     permanent $/mo passive income
//   perUnitCash          { assetId, amount }            one-time $ per unit OWNED
//   assetUnits           { assetId, percent }           lose/gain a % of the UNITS owned
//   businessIncomePercent{ percent }                    permanent % change to your best business
//   businessPause        { months }                     your businesses earn nothing for N months

// Business names — whimsical names assigned when a player starts a business

// Instead of a generic "Business #1", each new business gets a random funny
// name from this pool (see game/actions.js startBusiness), preferring one the
// player hasn't already used this game. 500 entries is comfortably more than
// any single game will ever need (a 24-month game realistically supports a
// handful of businesses per player), so repeats within a game are rare and
// repeats across different players/games don't matter.
